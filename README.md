Puzzle query is as given below.

There is total N persons. They made circle by standing one after one. The person number 1 has one knife. Person 1 kill person 2 and give that knife to person 3. person 3 kill the person 4 and give that knife to person 5. Person 5 kill person 6 and give knife to person 7.this procedure goes so on. if there is total 100 persons then the person 99 kill the person 100 and give that knife to person 1. This process stops when there is only on person left in the circle. So which number of person is the last standing person?

(Note:Here we take 100 as one reference number you can take any integer number as the input.)

(Note: If there is total 99 persons then the person 99 kill person 1 and give it to person 3. So it is not necessary that only even numbers will be eliminated.)

Solution of the above puzzle is getting by running the initial_start.py file.

(Note:I wrote this code to solve the puzzle. If you have more puzzles like this then please comment the puzzle. I will definitely try to solve your puzzle. And if i have time to publish the code of your puzzle then i will definitely publish it.)
